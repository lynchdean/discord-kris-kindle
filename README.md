# TODO (in order of priority)
- add unexclude instructions
- Command to list all exclusions
- !join prompt on server join
- self kick function
- help command with list of functions
- Add max limit to redraws to prevent max recursion errors where draw is not possible, or too complicated for the 
current random-order implementation. (Maybe add a limit to the entries or exclusions instead?)
